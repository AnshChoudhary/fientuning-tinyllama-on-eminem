stepfather hittin' my Ma\\nSocked her right in her eyeball\\nI'm startin' to think I'm psychotic\\nWith all the pictures I draw of\\nShit that I've already witnessed, it's probably twisted my thoughts\\nAll I can hear is drama with Mom and him\\nI can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways\\nThe walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm\\nOur dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard\\nDoctors had to put it down\\nHe killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!\\n\\n\\nI, I, hate\\nMy, my stepdad Stepdad\\nSo tonight I'm sayin', Bye bye stepdad Stepdad\\n\\nOutside, I look like I'm calm\\nInside, I'm a tickin' time bomb\\n'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom My mom\\nLast night, he said I left the kitchen light on\\nBut he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him\\nHickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty nine times\\nHe swatted me with it, I'd cry\\nHe just started hittin' me harder\\nGod, I wish I could just jaw him\\nIf I could get my weight up\\nBut I'm just a second grader\\nThis prick is bigger than I am\\nBut I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide\\nI'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time\\nSneak up with a lethal injection\\nAnd put him down like they did to my dog\\nI'm talkin' euthanasia Euthanasia, like kids in Taiwan\\nThis fuckin' shit's like Saigon Saigon\\nNeighbors called police on him\\nSo many battery charges, this dude's like lithium ion\\nThen Mom and him let bygones Bygones\\nJust be

on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'\\nHe walks by, kicks my arm and goes, Oops and just laughs\\nI yelled for Mom Mom and as she's rushin' to my defense\\nI stood up and said, Fuck you, punk and I took off and ran\\nTo my bedroom, as I fled\\nKnowin' shit would hit the fan\\nSlammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat\\nHe kicked it in\\nI swung it hard as I could at his head\\nHis noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed\\nI'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear\\nI threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass\\nBeat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad\\nDing dong, the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his\\nStomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two liter with\\nThen buried him next to my dog\\nAnd if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em\\n\\nI, I, hate\\nMy, my stepdad Stepdad\\nSo tonight I'm sayin', Bye bye stepdad Stepdad\\n'Cause I, I, hate\\nMy, my stepdad

dedicated\\nTo all the happy people\\nAll the happy people who have real nice lives\\nAnd have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck\\n\\n\\nI feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net\\nPoppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck\\nI deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check\\nI'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt\\nMinimum wage got my adrenaline caged\\nFull of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged\\nAnd my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper\\nI pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer\\nWatchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders\\nThese overnight stars becomin' autograph signers\\nWe all long to blow up and leave the past behind us\\nAlong with the small fries and average half pinters\\nBut player haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas\\n'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us\\nMoney'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless\\nThem snakes slither in the grass, spineless\\n\\nThat's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill\\nThat's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal\\nThat's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here\\n'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear\\nThat's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill\\nThat's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal\\nThat's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here\\n'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear\\n\\n\\nMy life is full of empty promises and broken dreams\\nI'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings\\nI feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished\\nLivin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished\\nAnd I'm sick of workin' dead end jobs with lame pay\\nAnd I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day\\nBut fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play\\n'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way\\n'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan\\nWhen all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan\\nOr comfortable and roomy in a 6\\nBut they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics\\nWho walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day\\nAnd yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today\\nMy daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play\\nLive half my life and throw the rest away\\n\\nThat's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill\\nThat's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal\\nThat's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here\\n'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear\\nThat's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill\\nThat's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal\\nThat's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here\\n'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear\\n\\n\\nThere's people that love me and people that hate me Yup\\nBut it's the evil that made me\\nThis backstabbin', deceitful and shady Mhm\\nI want the money, the women, the fortune and fame\\nThat means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame\\nThat means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name\\nThis lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain\\n'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom\\nI've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em Duh\\nI'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em\\nHoldin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em\\nMy daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em\\nAnd them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em\\nAnd while you flaunt 'em\\nI could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em\\nI got a couple of rings and a brand new watch, you want 'em?\\n'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song\\nI'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn\\n\\nThat's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill\\nThat's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal\\nThat's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here\\n'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear\\nThat's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill\\nThat's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal\\nThat's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had

that binded\\nSo many thingstime, I'd give anything to rewind it\\nI had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded\\nBy pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause\\nThat image burned in my brain of you on that table\\nMe falling across your body, not able to stand to save you\\nGod, why did you take him?\\nI'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?\\nLittle ladies, be brave, take care of your mother\\nSmile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other\\nI'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory\\nAnd I know you'll never forget me\\nJust don't get sad when remembering\\nAnd, little bro, keep making me proud\\nYou better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down\\nAnd when you're exchanging those sacred vows\\nJust know that if I could be there, I would\\nAnd should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it\\nOh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too\\nI actually learned a lot from you\\nYou taught me what not to do\\nAnd, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance\\nTo have one last heart to heart honest and open talk with you\\nDoody, I see you, I go to walk to you\\nAnd I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room\\nNurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out\\nThen the sheet over my head, shut the room down\\nGirls, please don't get upset\\nI see them cheeks soaking and wet\\nAs you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let\\nMe go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks\\nWith every second, each closer to death\\nBut suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow\\nThen a breath, machines go *beep beep beep*\\nMust've guessed the cheat codes to this shit\\nI'm tryna rewind time like a tape\\nFind an escape, make a beeline, try and awake\\nFrom this dream, I need to re find my inner strength\\nTo remind me, even if a steep climb I must take\\nTo rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape\\n\\nI don't want it!\\nI'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it\\nOne hundred percent finished, fed up with it\\nI'm hanging it up, fuck it!\\nExcuse the cursing, baby, but just know\\nThat I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold\\nAnd if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't\\nI'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet\\nShred these old letters I wrote\\nAll that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll\\nI'm proud to be back\\nI'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse\\nWith Recovery, Mathers LP2\\nHelp propel me to victory laps\\nGas toward 'em and fast forward the past\\nConsider them last four minutes as\\nThe song I'da sang to my daughters\\nIf I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it\\nAnd came back like a boomerang on 'em\\nNow a new day is dawnin'\\nI'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin'now I know\\n*Toilet flush*\\nPart 1, Produced by S1 and M Phazes\\n\\n\\nIt's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt\\nTried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work\\nAll it takes is one song on the radio, you're\\nRight back on it, reminding me all over again\\nHow you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt\\nSpent a lot of time tryna soul search\\nMaybe I needed to grow up a little first\\nWell, looks like I hit a growth spurt\\nBut I'm coming for closure\\nDon't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for\\nThe way that you turned your back on me\\nJust when I may have needed you most\\nOh, you thought it was over? You could just close the\\nChapter and go about your life like it was nothing\\nYou ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine\\nWell, I've never recovered\\nBut tonight I bet you that what you're\\n'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered\\nCan't think of a better way to define poetic justice\\nCan I hold grudges? Mind saying, Let it go, fuck this.\\nHeart's saying, I will, once I bury this bitch alive\\nHide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.\\n\\nI flee the scene like it was my last ride\\nYou see right through\\nOh, you had me pegged the first time\\nYou can see the truth, but it's easier to justify\\nWhat's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy\\nI just hate to be the bad guy\\nFollow me, I ruh uh un, follow me, I ruh uh un\\nI just hate to be the bad guy\\nFollow me, I ruh uh un, follow me, I ruh uh un\\n\\n\\nAnd to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch\\nTo think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit\\nThink you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?\\nNot this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!\\nFinish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit\\nThought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!\\nYou left our family in shambles\\nAnd you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?\\nMay be gone but he's not forgotten\\nAnd don't think 'cause he's been out the picture\\nSo long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya\\nYou're wrong and that shit was rotten\\nAnd the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold\\nHave you any idea the shit that I've gone through?\\nFeelings I harbor? All this pent up resentment I hold on to?\\nNot once you call to ask me how I'm doing\\nLetters, you don't respond to 'em\\nFuck it, I'm coming to see you\\nAnd, gee, who better to talk to than you?\\nThe cause of my problems\\nMy life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you\\nPoof, then I'm gone, voosh\\n\\nI flee the scene like it was my last ride\\nYou see right through\\nOh, you had me pegged the first time\\nYou can see the truth, but it's easier to justify\\nWhat's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy\\nI just hate to be the bad guy\\nFollow me, I ruh uh un, follow me, I ruh uh un\\nI just hate to be the bad guy\\nFollow me, I ruh uh un, follow me, I ruh uh un\\n\\n\\nI've been driving around your side of this town\\nLike 9 fricking hours and 45 minutes now\\nFinally I found your new address, park in your drive\\nFeel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life\\nAnd it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva\\nMy knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house\\nSee, it's sad it came to this point\\nSuch a disappointment I had to make this appointment\\nTo come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy\\nI don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy\\nIt's revenge that I seek\\nSo I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window\\nLike I reach my full potentialI peeked\\nContinue to peep, still bent low, then keep\\nTapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak\\nAll the way 'round to the back porch\\nMan, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this\\nYou don't plan for intruders beforehand?\\nSurprised to see me?

grass\\nBut I specialize in eating MC's\\nIn the immortal words of LL Cool J\\nAs he would say, I'm a G.O.A.T.!\\nAnd for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is\\nIt means the Greatest Of All Time\\nAnd I consider myself one of those\\nSo thank you very much, here it goes\\n\\n\\nThis is the part I was worried about\\nEveryone thinks that my career is down the tubes\\nAnd I'm in some dusty garage\\nInhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes\\nAnd everyone's tellin' me what I should do\\nAnd how I should come out and what to rap about\\nAnd I know I got a lot up\\nIn my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out\\nAnd I'm not sure how this is gonna come off\\nThey're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky\\nLike I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me\\nSee, the thing about me\\nIs you don't really know a thing about me\\nEveryone's makin' a stink about me\\nLike there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me\\nSurround me with nothin' but gangsters\\nKillers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals\\nAnd I feel like I'm more comfortable around them\\nThan I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors\\nBut see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave\\nBut why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other MC's?\\nSo when Weezy says that he's better than Jay Z\\nPlease be that just subliminally\\nMeans he thinks Jigga's the best\\nAnd that he's the only one up in that league, see\\nAnd it's easy just to consider me\\nOne of the greatest white rappers there is\\nKnowin' goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived, period\\n\\nI'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat\\nBut I know what I know and I know what you think\\nAnd these magazines'll never put it in ink\\nBecause how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?\\nAnd for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is\\nIt means the Greatest Of All Time\\nAnd I consider myself one of those\\nSo thank you very much, here it goes\\n\\n\\nMaybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game\\nSo they gotta go try to find 'em a new Eminem or a new Shady\\nIf they think it's gonna happen, man, I thought I was crazy\\nOr maybe I could be takin' it wrong\\nAnd they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way\\nSo let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way\\nSee, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up that Paul Wall's white\\n'Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight\\nAnd Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write\\nBecause he's so caught up in that snow white\\nThat Timbaland can't even get him in the studio\\nHe's so gone off that coke, right?\\nAnd it's so sad 'cause he's dope, right?\\nAmerica's next great white hope, right?\\nSo now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass White Rapper Show, right?\\nAnd which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about\\nThey said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out\\nThere's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black\\nAnd runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth\\nAnd I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit\\nIsn't it ironic that the best rapper's white\\nAnd the best golfer's black?\\nAnd I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that\\nBut these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out\\nBut I had already hit middle America\\nParents had all got to likin' me now\\nWhen suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy\\nAll of the hatred for me must've died\\nThought I committed career suicide\\nSo I had to turn back into the bad guy\\nSo faggoty faggoty faggoty gays\\nAnatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy\\nNot Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy\\nAnd Angelina Jolie is just another ho\\nAnd Brad is a sucka, because once I fuck her\\nShe wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby\\nYou know what I say?  No.\\nYou better save some of them kids from Madonna\\nShe needs all the publicity she can get\\nYou wanted Shady, well you got it, man, I ain't apologizin' for shit\\n\\nI'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat\\nBut I know what I know and I know what you think\\nAnd these magazines'll never put it in ink\\nBecause how would it look\\nIf they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?\\nAnd for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is\\nIt means the Greatest Of All Time\\nAnd I consider myself one of those\\nSo thank you very much, here it goes\\n\\n\\nMan, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home\\nMan, shit is too easy\\nNobody even wants to pass me the ball\\n'Cause I'm a G.O.A.T.\\nSo don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game\\nAnd y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best\\nBut y'all know that I'm a G.O.A.T.\\nAnd like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best\\nBefore you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch\\nBut before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much\\nTo everybody who wasn't there from the start\\nAnd thank you very much to everybody who was\\nAnd y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it\\n'Cause I know that you know that I know\\nThat you know that I know that I'm a G.O.A.T.\\nI'm out y'all, it's been realpeace!\\nTrack 22 On\\nStraight from the Lab Part 2\\nView Tracklist \\nIt's Been Real\\nEminem\\nThis was recorded by Eminem sometime after Proof Died in 2006, but before Relapse.
